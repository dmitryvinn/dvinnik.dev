He touches on his brilliant 'Explain Like I'm 5' series, in which members of the open source developer advocate team explain complex technologies in a simple and accessible way.</p>\n<p>He also talks about how the team manages to provide support across hundreds of open source projects, and discusses the importance of building narratives to enable clarity and set priorities. </p>\n<p>Dmitry also explains why developer advocates need to be platform agnostic and meet communities where they exist (rather than forcing them into new platforms and tools), and tells us about the role that open source plays more generally in Facebook's work.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.talkabouttechpodcast.com/1712587/8506173\">Link to the podcast</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Location</strong></p>\n<p>Virtual</p>\n<p><strong>About the Engagement</strong></p>\n<p>What We Talk About When We Talk About Tech is a podcast about tech storytelling.
