As a Developer, have you ever thought of testing to be much easier than feature work? If any of these thoughts went through your head at one point, this talk is for you!</p>\n<p>Nowadays, the fine line between testers and developers is challenged daily, and more companies are moving towards the so-called Hybrid Model. With everyone in the company becoming a Software Engineer, it might be scary to face it unprepared.  As Hybrid Model is gaining more popularity, it is essential to get ready for this transition whether you are a developer or a tester.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we look at successful and failed examples of companies transitioning into using the Hybrid Model.
