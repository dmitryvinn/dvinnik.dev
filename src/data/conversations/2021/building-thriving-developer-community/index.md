**About the Engagement**


Developer Relations professionals act as a liaison between their company and technical communities. They communicate feedback, advocate for the community’s needs, and make their experience with their product as smooth as possible.

As people seek new opportunities to meet and collaborate with like-minded developers locally and globally, community-led developer events are becoming more important than ever. The impact of today’s leading DevRel programs are driven by the grassroots, passionate community organizers.
