**Overview**

Improving organizational efficiency is not an easy feat. While automation and innersource are important, it also requires strong collaboration, goals, and clarity—in essence, a cultural shift.

Join Virginia Bryant, Director of Customer Marketing at GitHub, as she hears from Meta’s Developer Advocate, Dmitry Vinnik, DXC Technology’s Distinguished Engineer, DevOps Enablement, Tom Halpin, and 3M’s Operations and Quality Manager, Tina Beamer. We’re excited to discuss how they’re leveraging innersource to encourage strong collaboration and deliver high-quality code.
