**Elevator Pitch (~300 words)**

In this talk, we discuss how to use Domain knowledge around your product to help improve your Software Quality. We use Domain Driven Testing tools to ensure we validate what your customers work with rather than what you think they might use.

**Abstract**
 
"I tested it how you told me to," "Requirements say it's expected," "I assumed it's fine" – these are the common phrases you hear when customer cases come up. Unfortunately, it is nothing unusual in our industry to be detached from customers' actual needs. As a result, teams regularly fail when they prioritize requirements over actual behavior that the customers expect.

This problem of misaligned teams' focus is where Domain Driven Testing (DDT) comes into play. DDT helps developers to put themselves into the customers' shoes and see the product for what it is. This prioritization of the actual behavior over the mere following of the requirements is what defines Domain Driven Testing.

In this talk, we discuss how knowledge of your company's domain (aka, the focus of your business) can improve your testing practices. We talk about Domain Driven Design techniques, Exploratory Testing, and other methods that emphasize software quality through customer success. We touch bases on tools you can integrate into your system using Domain Driven Test Pyramid, and what common mistakes you should avoid when implementing Domain Driven Testing.

**Takeaways**

1. Core principles behind Domain Driven Design 
2. How-to's of Domain Driven Test Pyramid
