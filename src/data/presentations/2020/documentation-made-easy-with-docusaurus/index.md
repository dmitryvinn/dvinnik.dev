**Elevator Pitch (~300 words)**

In this session, we will walk through getting started with Docusaurus, its architecture and MDX support

**Abstract**
 
Do you know how to get someone to do something difficult? Make it easy! Documentation is one of those things: everyone understands it's important, but few want to write it. And if the docs platform is difficult to use or extend, doc writing becomes a punishment. Docusaurus is here to help!

In this session, we will walk through getting started with Docusaurus, its architecture and MDX support. We will explore built-in themes with plugins, and even create one during the talk. So, let's learn how to make doc writing enjoyable, together!
