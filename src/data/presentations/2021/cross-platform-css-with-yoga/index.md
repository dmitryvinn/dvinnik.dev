**Elevator Pitch (~300 words)**

In this talk, we learn about Yoga's main concepts and use-cases. Then, we will build a demo app for React Native and Android to showcase the reusability of Yoga.

**Abstract**
 
It's no secret that people view the same website across many devices, browsers, and screen sizes. To make the same app work on all these platforms, developers have to spend a significant amount of time. If only there were an engine that allows web developers to write their code once and use it everywhere.

Presenting Yoga, an open source, cross-platform layout engine that uses CSS layouts to manage user interfaces across platforms. 

In this talk, we learn about Yoga's main concepts and use-cases. Then, we will build a demo app for React Native and Android to showcase the reusability of Yoga.
