**Abstract**
 
So many platforms, so little time. How do we write an app for the web, Android, iOS, and other OS without spending all our time and money? Cross-platform can be your answer!

You probably heard about React Native before, a framework that allows you to create native Android and iOS apps using React. But how do you get started with the framework? Whether you are an advanced iOS developer or a beginner React dev, this talk will help you get started with React Native.

In this session, we explore React Native and its main concepts. Then, we will build a demo app from scratch for Android and iOS to show the power of cross-platform that the framework brings to the table!
