**Elevator Pitch (~300 words)**

In this talk, we learn how to debug Android, iOS, and React Native apps with Flipper. Then, we will build a new plugin for Flipper to show how flexible the platform is.


**Abstract**
 
As a developer, where do you think you spend most of your time doing? In most cases, the answer would be debugging. 

Whenever something breaks, getting to the root cause can only be done by debugging through logs, reporting systems, and other tools.

But what if it wasn't that complex and unpleasant? Flipper, an extensible mobile app debugger, aims to make the developer experience a lot better! Flipper inspects, visualizes, and controls your apps from a simple desktop interface. 

In this talk, we learn how to debug Android, iOS, and React Native apps with Flipper. Then, we will build a new plugin for Flipper to show how flexible the platform is.
