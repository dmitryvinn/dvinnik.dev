**Abstract**
 
Does Behavior Driven Development work? Unfortunately, it often does not. While many people try to pitch BDD to bridge the gap between stakeholders, many teams fail to communicate their test scenarios with everyone involved. 

It does not help that many of the BDD tools like Cucumber can be challenging to implement and maintain. More often than not, these difficulties of BDD frameworks outweigh the benefits.

Fortunately, the tech industry has seen a new wave of behavior-driven development adoption, thanks to Gauge and Taiko frameworks. With these two tools, teams get an effective combination of a testing tool and a communication channel.

In this talk, we discuss BDD principles and how Gauge+Taiko can take your team to the next level of testing collaboration. We take a deep dive into these tools and their application to web development. To ensure your success, we look at common mistakes made during the initial implementation of BDD on organizational and team levels.
