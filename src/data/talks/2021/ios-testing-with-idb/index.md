**Elevator Pitch (~300 words)**

In this session, we talk about the iOS native ecosystem, the challenges in testing that iOS developers encounter, and how to simplify the workflow with the idb.

**Abstract**
 
Testing in the iOS space is tough! An extensive set of devices and models and a somewhat closed ecosystem make running tests an enormous challenge. 

Fortunately, open source projects like the [iOS development bridge (idb)](https://fbidb.io/) help us scale QA efforts. This command-line interface was designed to automate iOS simulators and devices, allowing developers to work between a fleet of machines so that automation on iOS can be distributed amongst these machines. 

In this session, we talk about the iOS native ecosystem, the challenges in testing that iOS developers encounter, and how to simplify the workflow with the idb.
