**Elevator Pitch (~300 words)**

In this talk, we learn how to use Fresco and build a demo app to show how images can be progressively shown on the device.

**Abstract**
 
Scale matters! The amount of data people go through the day on their phones is astounding, especially when it involves images and videos. With most of us being on the go, the network becomes a big concern as the connection is not the same worldwide.

Here is where Fresco comes in! This powerful system for displaying images in Android applications adjusts image quality to the device and the network. 

In this talk, we learn how to use Fresco and build a demo app to show how images can be progressively shown on the device.
